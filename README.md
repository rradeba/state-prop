Module 11 Lesson 1: Assignments | React Fundamentals
1. Building a Basic React Functional Component Portfolio
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice the fundamentals of React by building a basic portfolio web page using functional components. This assignment focuses on understanding the structure and syntax of class components in React, without diving into props or states.

Problem Statement: Create a simple portfolio webpage with three main sections - a header, an about section, and a contact section - using functional components in React. This webpage will serve as a basic introduction to the structure and capabilities of React's functional component system.

Task 1: Create a Header Section

Write a functional component named Header that includes a background image and you or a fictional character name overlaying the background image. 
Expected Outcome: A functional class component named Header rendering an image and a name as part of the portfolio.



Task 2: Create an About Section

Write a functional component named About that includes a brief description of yourself or a fictional character. This component should contain a heading and a paragraph.
Expected Outcome: A functional class component named About rendering a heading and a paragraph as part of the portfolio.



Task 3: Create a Contact Section

Develop a class component named Contact that displays simple contact information such as email or a LinkedIn profile.
Expected Outcome: A Contact class component successfully renders contact information, demonstrating the ability to structure and render basic content in a React class component.



Task 4: Import components into an App component

Develop a functional component called  App that imports and displays your  Header,   About, and Contact components.
Expected Outcome: An App functional component that successfully renders/displays all other components in an organized fashion demonstrating the ability to import and display/use components within other components.

NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that when your code is cloned down, we should be able to install the dependencies and run the react app. Your components should be implemented and all code should run as expected and asked for in the assignment.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your React app runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
